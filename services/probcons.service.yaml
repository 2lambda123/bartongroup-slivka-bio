form:
  input:
    label: Input file
    value:
      type: file
      required: yes
      media-type: application/fasta

  output-aligned:
    label: Output aligned
    description: Output sequences in alignment order rather than input order
    value:
      type: boolean
      required: no

  pre-training:
    label: Rounds of pre-training before aligning the sequences
    description: 'This specifies the number of rounds of EM to be 
      applied on the set of sequences being aligned. This option is 
      used in case the default parameters are not appropriate for 
      the particular sequences being aligned; in general, this option 
      is not recommended as it may lead to unstable alignment parameters.'
    value:
      type: int
      required: no
      min: 0
      max: 20
      default: 0

  iterative-refinement:
    label: Passes of iterative refinement
    description: 'This specifies the number of iterations of iterative 
      refinement to be performed.  In each stage of iterative refinement, 
      the set of sequences in the alignment is randomly partitioned into 
      two groups. After projecting the alignments to these groups, the 
      two groups are realigned, resulting in an alignment whose objective 
      score is guaranteed to be at least that of the original alignment'
    value:
      type: int
      required: no
      min: 0
      max: 100
      default: 100

  consistency:
    label: Passes of consistency transformation
    description: 'Each pass applies one round of the consistency 
      transformation on the set of sequences. The consistency 
      transformation is described in detail in the mentioned papers. 
      In each round, the aligner computes the consistency transformation 
      for each pair of sequences using all other sequences. The aligner 
      then updates the posterior probability matrices of the pairwise 
      alignments.'
