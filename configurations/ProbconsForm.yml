output-aligned:
  label: Output aligned
  description: Output sequences in alignment order rather than input order
  value:
    type: boolean
    required: no

pre-training:
  label: Rounds of pre-training before aligning the sequences
  description: >-
    This specifies the number of rounds of EM to be applied on the set of
    sequences being aligned. This option is used in case the default parameters
    are not appropriate for the particular sequences being aligned; in general,
    this option is not recommended as it may lead to unstable alignment parameters.
  value:
    type: int
    required: no
    min: 0
    max: 20
    default: 0

iterative-refinement:
  label: Passes of iterative refinement
  description: >-
    This specifies the number of iterations of iterative refinement to be performed.
    In each stage of iterative refinement, the set of sequences in the alignment
    is randomly partitioned into two groups. After projecting the alignments to
    these groups, the two groups are realigned, resulting in an alignment whose
    objective score is guaranteed to be at least that of the original alignment
  value:
    type: int
    required: no
    min: 0
    max: 100
    default: 100

consistency:
  label: Passes of consistency transformation
  description: >-
    Each pass applies one round of the consistency transformation on the set of sequences.
    The consistency transformation is described in detail in the mentioned papers. In each
    round, the aligner computes the consistency transformation for each pair of sequences
    using all other sequences. The aligner then updates the posterior probability matrices of
    the pairwise alignments.
  value:
    type: int
    required: no
    min: 0
    max: 5
    default: 2
